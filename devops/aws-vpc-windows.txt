vpc:
===
priate ip adress will get from vpc only
public ip you will get in region which have you created
 connection flow 
 laptop---->internet gateway--->public subnet---->ec2 instance
 
 vpc---vertuval private cloud
 the range of ec2 machines inside the vpc depend on the range of vpc
 vpc basi resources are
 sub nets 
 gateways
 route tables
 two type of subnets are there we already know
  i have created two ec2 machines inside the vpc one is connected to public sunet another is connected to private 
  first machine can connect to out side env of vpc through IGW .
  second machinecannot connct because it has private sub net. if we want to connect our machine to out side first connect too first machine and connect to out side of vpc

first conncet to first machine thn it is not able to connect directly to second machine
first it is connect to public subnet and after it is communicate with private subnet of second machine 


goto vpc dash board 
create vpc 
give vpc name
ipv4 CIDR block:20.0.0.0/16
click on create vpc

now goto subnets

give the sub name as public subnet
ip range:20.0.0.0/24 
click on create VPC

NOW CREATE ANOTHER SUBNET NAMED IT AS PRIVATE SUBNET
CIDR BLOCK :20.0.1.0/24  
NOW CLICK ON CREATE

now we are goto internet gateways
click on create internet gateway---give the name and click on create
now goto actions and attach the igw to vpc

now goto route tables
 crate route table--->give the name --->select our required vpc--->create route table
 select our route table
 ---click on routes--->click on edit routs--add route---give 0.0.0.0/0--->under target -->select internet gateway
 --->select our internetgate way--->now click on save rules
  then click subnet association--- click on edit subnet association-->select our subnets
  
  now let me create ec2 instance inside my vpc right now
  
  select windows ami
  on step 3 select our vpc--->select public subnet--launch instane
  now one more machine is created using private subnet
  
  now i want to login to first system and goro run enter remote desktop connection now it will ask the ip address
  now copy our private ip address and enter it in ip adress
click on connect
then it will asks the username and password
give the user name is Administrator
passwd is decripted passwd-->which obtained from private subnet mahine
 now click on connect--->now it is connect


vpc in linux
============
resources
1.vpc
2.subnet
3.route tables
4.internet gateway
5.two ec2 instances
1.vpc:give the name to vpc--->select the range--->create vpc
2.subnet:give the name of subnet -->select region--->give the range-->create subnet
3.route tables:create new route table--->edit routes--->atach internet gatway--->range 0.0.0.0/0--->save it
   edit subnet associations--->select both the subnets---->save them
4.internet gateway:attach the internetgateway to ourvpc
ssh -i keyname ec2-user@private ip address of second machine  
5.generate two ec2 machines--->usingourvpc and public and private subnets--->for public instance select urvpc,public subnet--->auto assigmn publicip :enable
                                                                             
																			for private instance select urvpc,public subnet--->auto assigmn publicip :disable
6.login to the publick instance and take the pem file into the vi editor ,give the any name to that file
   give the permissions to the file
   chmod 400 file name 
   ssh -i filename ec2-user@private ip address of second machine.
