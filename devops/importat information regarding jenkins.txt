jenkins
-------
simple project--->under build section---clickexecute shell---echo "welcome to jenkins"
--- goto dashboard of jenkins--click on build now

plugins:
deploy to container---it is helpful for to deploy war or jar files



goto git hub and copy the link addess and give it in the scm of jenkins dash board
and click on build section ---invoke top levelmaven targets---under the goals ---clean package

difference between poll scm and build  periodically
----------------------------------------------------
inpoll scm: 

whenever the developer changes the code the job will be triggered based on our scedule

build periodically:
------------------
it is not based on develepor change .based our scedule time it wii trigger.
so continuously tirigger goes to hang the vertual machine
webhooks:
-----------
it is not in jenkins dashboard.this webhooks are placed in the github .whenever the change done by developer 
it can triggers immediatly

configuration:
--------------
	goto github --- goto settings---select webhook---addwebhook--under payload url--give the jenkins url----
	under content type ---select json files

change the port number in jenkins:
----------------------------------
   vi /etc/sysconfig/jenkins 
   
how to perameterize builds in jenkins:
--------------------------------------
we need to install git perameter plugin 
senario:developer requests to raise the ops(ours) team
he asks can you please test the war file is generated or not in dev/master/feture branch ? 
GOTO DASHBOARD OF JENKINS
in general section we have to select "This project is parameterised"
under that
name:whatever  ---example --branch
parameter type:branch
default value:${BRANCH}:i want all branches .thats way I have to use 
${BRANCH}
this plugin provides we can make the jobs on which branch you want
it asks on which branch do you wants to run the job

sequential jobs or upstream and down stream jobs
=================================================
i want to create three jobs. these three jobs are run in one after another
as continuously loop
we need to install two plkugins
1.build pipeline plugin
2.delivery pipeline plugin
here we get visuvalization is different
goto dash board 
install build pipeline plugin--goback to dash boadrd and click on the + symbol and select the build pipeline option
