git branch dev ----->here we can create a new branch
git push origin dev --->we can push the branch local to remote
git branch -d dev -->delete branch in locally
git pusg origin -d dev --> delete branch in rem,otely
git checkout master -->goto inside the branch 

merging stratagies
------------------
1.fast-farward merge
-------------------------
 we  work on the file in the feture branch it connot merge to master,
 first we have to merge it with development branch
 git commit is done at feature branch and git checkout to dev branch
 then we have to merge
 modification on file in feature branch---->merge it with dev-->dev branch is merge with master

2.two way or recursive merge 
------------------------------
 create file in fet branch --->chekout to dev --->again create a file -->merge fet-->:wq!
 checkout to master--->again create a file and git merge dev 

3.rebase :this is very dangerous command .due to this one we lost the entire project information
---------
git cherrypic:
--------------
it picks a commit from one branchand applies it to another branch withuot doing merge

command git cherry-pick commit id
 create one file in fet branch and copy the commit id and switched to dev then -->git cherry-pick  commit id-->checkout to master git cherrypick commit id 

remote side merges(pull requests)



git tags :
creation of tags is same as branches but difference is 
code is developed in branches but on top of code this tags are created
