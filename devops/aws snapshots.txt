df -h --->it is used to know the how much storage is available()storage of our linux machine)
free -m  --->how much ram i have given
yum -->it is used for install a package (java,mysql,python)
yum install http* -y ---->it is used for complete http package
systemctl status httpd
ctrl+l --->it can clear all the screen
system ctl start httpd
press home button we can go to starting of the command
press end button we can go to ending of the command

systemctl enable httpd 
systemctl status httpd
as of now this server is normal server.when ever you
 install http the server becom web server.now we will communicate through ip address
 now I want to communicate with my mobile for that use following command
 vim /var/www/html/index.html
     hi this is ram
	 save the message
	 
chmod 777 /var/www/html/index.html

systemctl restart httpd

enable port number 80

then go to google chrome and give the public ip

snapshots for linux machine
===========================
let us create two machines
one is in one region and another is in another zone
BY TAKING THE SNAPSHOT FOR VOLUME IN ONE zone IT CAN BE MOVED TO ANOTHER ZONE AND ATTACHED TO another instance


lsblk :this command shows the volume space
 now we have to attach avolume to our instance 
 now goto terminal and check it by using the command
 
 lsblk
 
 now we have to formate our volume so by using following command we can do that
 
 mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf 
 lsblk ---->here we can observe that mount point will blank
 now create a directory and attach the volume to my directory
 mkdir flipkart
 mount /dev/xvdf /root/flipkart --->this command can attach our directory to volume
 lsblk ---> now we can observe that mount point
 cd flipkartc
 ll
 touch file1 file2 file3 file4
 
 now three file are there in etra volume now i want to attach this volume to zone-b machine 
 but we cannot do that ,with the help of snapshot we can do that
 now goto volumes  goto actions and click on snapshot noe give the name to snapshot 
 and create now goto snapshot we can see the snapshot 
 now goto another machine whgich is run in another zone

now we can observe that snapshot is ready and create one more volume from the snapshot
in zone c using the snapshot

creation of volume from snapshot
=================================
select snapshot -->goto actions create volume--->give name give another zone

now the volume is ready to use

the volume is attached to the instance which is in the same zone (volume and instance are in same zone)
lsblk
now we can observe the 3 files in this machine which are present due to attached volume 
 now we need not to formate .


mkdir snapdeal
mount /dev/nvme1n1/root/snapdeal ; now the volume is attached to snapdeal
lsblk ;at this we can observe mount process
 cd snapdeal
 ll
 all the thre files are available here
 now i want to create a machine in london rergion and attach this volume 
 
 we have to goto actions in snapshot click on copy and select the region london then click on copy
 now we can attach the volume to ou machine which is present in the london region
 now we login to the machine
 now we need to check how many volumes are there in machine
here we can observe attached volume
mkdir snapdeal
now we need to mount 
mount /dev/xvdf /root/snapdeal

lsblk :now we can observe that mount de atails also
cd snapdeal
ll
