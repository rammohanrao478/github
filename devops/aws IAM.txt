 IAM roles:
 ----------
 we requre a IAM user login into EC2 machine ,those are 'acces key' 'scret access key',
there is another way is also there for login to the ec2 machine by using roles
	using roles user can login to  ec2 machine
	
	role is nothing but set of permissions
	ec2,s3 ,rds,elastic cahe resources in aws .with out acces key and secete acces key we can acces the resouces usingroles

create role-->from resouce is ec2 to resouce(ec2 machine to s3 resource)
select first ec2--->next--select s3 full acces---tags are optional---now give the name of role ---click on create role

now launch a machine--->login to the machine ---aws s3 ls---it can ask do aws configure first---now goto actions
---instance settings--- attach IAM role---select our created role--apply
now we can see the buckets with out enter aws config--->aws s3 ls-->we can see how many buckets are present in our aws account
this is usage of IAM role
