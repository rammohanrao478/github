practice-1:
===========
maven and tomcat simple project:
=================================
1.launch two instances 
2.install java,git,maven in one of the instances 
3.install tomcat in another instance and goto tomcat/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml--->remove value line
  ans goto tomcat/conf/tomcatusers.xml and give passwd and user name,manager-gui,manager-script
4.now we need to enter the following command for generating war file--clean packge
5. this war file need to copy to webapps directory of tomcat
6.this is possuble when only the connection is formed between tomcat and maven instances.this 
 is done by ssh configuration
7 do the ssh configuration from maven to tomcat.


maven environmental setup:
==========================
M2_HOME=/opt/apache-maven-3.8.6
M2=/opt/apache-maven-3.8.6/bin
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.312.b07-1.amzn2.0.2.x86_64/jre
PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$M2_HOME:$M2
for ssh configuration
------------------------

cd target

vi /tmp/ansible.pem
give the pem file here

now we need to give the user level permissions to above file


chmod 700 /tmp/ansible.pem
then give the following command to copy the war file from maven to webapps directory of tom cat

scp -i  /tmp/ansible.pem myweb.war-8.2.0 ec2-user@public or private ip of tomcat instance:/opt/apche-tomcat-8/webapps

here aldso we get permission denied .now we need to give the permissions like this

chmod 777 webapps
