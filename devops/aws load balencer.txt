LOAD BALANERS:
==============
load balencers does'nt have ip address these contain DNS .this is given to end user

We install http in our linux instance 

yum install http* -y 
systemctl status httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd

vim /var/www/html/index.html
now we can write amessage
we need to give permission
chmod 777 /var/www/html/index.html
systemctl restart httpd
take the public ip along with port no 80


load balancer balancing the load between the different servers

one of the importent aontent is involved here that is "target group"
loadbalancer will not connect to server directly--->my load balancer will always connect to my target group
targetgroup is nothing but group of servers
loab balencer will always searches for target groups
before going to create load balencer we have to create target group



now goto load balencers in aws console
click on create target group
give the name of target group
target type instance
protocal :http
port :80
click on create-------------->at this time i have created a target group but not create attach to any server
go bottom and select targetsand click on edit target---->select your linux machine don't click on save-->click on add to registered---then click on save
as of now i have created a machine and add the target group to my linux machine

now i have created a loadbalancer 
cick on loadbalancer -->create loadbalancer--->select application/http load balencer 

then we have 6 steps
1.configure load balencer
 give the name of load balencer
 select all availablity zones---now click on next
2.configure security settings -->our ec2 instance has security group same as that every load balencer a security group
3.configure security group
now we observe that on which security group our instance will run and the security group we have to select
(security group gor instance =security group for load balencer)

4.configure routing:

targetgroup:select existing
name :give tne name what the target group you have created---click on next

5.register targets:
here we can observe the instance id---it displaying that one machine is present in our target group---click on next

6.reviw 
here we can obsrve what we doing in previous steps

click on creat:-- now we get the load balencer
afetr creation of our load balencer we can observe the DNS name

whenever loadbalancer get active state--->give the DNS name in web brouser we got the message 1 million user,2 million user,2 million users login through this DNS name

load balencer work flow
chrome--->DNS/Loadbalencer--->target group -->inside the targetgroup is linux machine-->from there it will show the message

and we will get the message from loadbalencer dns name
