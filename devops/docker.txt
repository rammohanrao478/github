A service can be defined as a logical set of pods. It can be defined as an abstraction on the
 top of the pod which provides a single IP address and DNS name by which pods can be accessed. 
With Service, it is very easy to manage load balancing configuration. It helps pods to scale 
very easily.

docker:
virtual machine                        docker
memory utilization is not in perfect   no memory wastae
                                      here we have use whole memory
                                       docker is a containerization tool
vm ware :multiple operating systems can be managed here
ex:windows,ubuntu,linux
vm ware works upon the hypervizer

docker:
=======
developer develop the code and that code can be shipped them into container
in a system create a ec2 instance we install docker then we create n number of
containers depends on system


docker follows clint server architecture.its contains mainly three parts
1.client:
=========
docker provides CLI tools to client to interactwith docker daemon.client can build,run and stop application
 
 docker installation steps:
 ===========================
 1.we need to take one ec2 instane
 2.install docker
   yum install docker -y
   service docker start
   ifconfig -a
   
docker intigration with jenkins
================================

to the configuration of abuve setup we rwequire two instances
one for jenkins another for docker
1.now we have to loginto the docker instance 
  useradd docker3
  passwd docker3
2.vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
now have to remove the # infront of Permit Rootlogin yes ,password authendication yes
now save it
3.vi /etc/sudoers ------------>esc,shift+g,o --->by doing this we can goto botom of the text
 add the following at the lost column
 docker3   ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD:ALL
 now save it
service sshd start
  su -docker3
 ssh-keygen -t rsa    ---enter--enter
 sudo service sshd restart
this process is also done at jenkins side also(we have to do ssh configuration from jenkins to docker)
1.now we have to loginto the jenkins instance 
  useradd docker3
  passwd docker3
2.vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
now have to remove the # infront of Permit Rootlogin yes ,password authendication yes
now save it
3.vi /etc/sudoers ------------>esc,shift+g,o --->by doing this we can goto botom of the text
 add the following at the lost column
 docker3   ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD:ALL
 now save it
service sshd start
  su -docker3
 ssh-keygen -t rsa    ---enter--enter
 sudo service sshd restart
 ssh-copy-id docker instance public ip
 now it asks the passwd (docker3)
 here connectiomn is formed
jenkins integrate with docker 
=============================
1.we need to install plugin:publishoverssh
2managejenkins---configure system---ssh servers--give the name----under host name we have to give 
docker private id---username:docker3---click on advanced--select use passwd authendication--give the passwd
---now click on the test configuration---it must be success--apply --save
now we have to create job in jenkins
=====================================
new item ---give job name--select freestyle---give git hub url---give clean package
click on add build step
select "send files or exicute commands over ssh SSH"
under source file "target/*.war"
under remove prefix--/target
under remote directory
/opt/docker -------apply--save
now click on build now
now we have to go to docker instane
ls 
opt will present under opt/docker war file will appear

now we have to write the docker file 
======================================
FROM tomcat:8
#take the war file and copy to the webapps of tomcat
COPY /opt/docker/myweb-8.2.0.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/myweb.war

under docker instane

sudo vi Dockerfile---copy the above commands
now we have to create the docker image+++++++++++++++






1.WE HAVE TO CREATE TWO INSTANCES
2. one is for jenkins ,one is for docker
3.goto jenkins-














































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































 













































































































sudo docker build -t tomcat:kalpana .
now here docker image is created here and also the war file copied into the webapps 
now we have to create docker container

sudo docker run -itd --name chiru -p 1995:8080 image id

now we have to take docker "publicip:1995/myweb/"

if deployment is failed in QA environment  ,now we have to run the dockerfile
vi Dockerfile
FROM tomcat:8.0
WORKDIR /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/
RUN wget paste the link fron nexus
EXPOSE 8080
#cmd ["/opt/tomcat/bin/catalina.sh", "run" 

sudo docker build -t tomcat:nani .

now we have to create container from above image

sudo docker run -itd  --name samantha -p 1986:8080 image id 

now take the docker publicip:8080/myweb-8.2.0

now we get the result 
nexus is used for backup here
