elastic cache:
=============
 elastic cache is a smaller data base it is inbetwwen the ec2 machine and RDS
 
 in connection between ec2 machine and rds 
 two operations are done inbetween these RDS and instance those are 
 1.read operation, 2.write operation
 
 when er you are enter the first time you have to logged in it will keep them in elastic cache
 second time you want to log in it all fast to connect baecause already username and password are stored in elastic cache
 this one is first befit and the second benfit is it can reduce the load on RDS 
 
 here different types of caches are there 
 they are
 1.redis cache 
 2.memcache

go to AWS elastic cache  
now goto select redies cache--->click on create--->select redies cache-->give the name --->flipkart
engine version compatibility:6.2(select latest one)
give the port number of elasti cache port number : 6379 for memcache port:11211
click node type:t2.micro
no.of replicas :1



multi AZ select that one
 name:subnet
 description:leave it
 vpc id :default vpc
 select the all the subnets
 show logs :selct
 log formate:text
 destination type:cloudwatch logs
 log destination :create new-->logs--->depend on our requireent we can configure remaining
 now click on create 
 the same above steps are used for creation of memcache
 
 now I WANT TO CREATE A aws instance to connect elastic cache
 then goto scurity group and select all trafic , ipv4 from any where now login to our linux machine
 now we have to install telnet
 yum install -y telnet --->telnet is a protocal through which we connect the elastic cache
 now goto elastic cache and copy the elastic cache endpoint and goto instance terminal and give the followig command



           telnet (elasticcache end point) and remove the colon inbetween endpoint portnumber 6379
		   
after enter this comand right noew you are in inside the lastic cache
 
 now we can enter the followig commands
      set a = 'vinay'
	  get a
