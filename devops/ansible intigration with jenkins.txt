ansible integration with jenkins:
================================
prerequsites:
1.jenkins instance
2.ansible control master(ACM)
3.two nodes

communication is required between jenkins and ACM ,nodes and ACM
================================================================
 so we need to provide ssh configuration between them.
 
 ssh configuration steps:
 ------------------------
 1.useradd ansible
 2.passwd ansible
 3.vi /etc/ss/sshd_config
 4.vi /etc/sudoers
 5.service sshd start
 6.su - ansible
 7.ssh-keygen
 8.service sshd restart
 
 jenkins integrate with ACM:
 ===========================
 ---> after ssh configuration we need to login to jenkins and install the plugin "publish over ssh"
---->goto configure system---->gotobottum--->select ssh servers--->give the name and--->host name "give the private ip of ACM"--->username  "ANSIBLE"
         click on advanced give passwd and test configuration,its enogh to connection between ACM and jenkins is ready

tomcat install
==============
we have to run the playbook in node1 
we need to change the username as tomcat to root 
chown -R ansible:ansible tomcat
cd tomcat 
chmod 777 webapps
now we require tomcat to deploy
we can install tomcat throuh mannually or run the tomcat playbook in ACM
HERE WE USE PLAY BOOK TO INSTALL TOMCAT
now we need to edit tomcatusers.xml and tomcat context.xml
cd tomcat/conf/------>tomcatusers.xml
cd tomcat/webapps/manager/META-INF--->context.xml

plybook for copy the war file from jenkinsto ACM

---
- hosts:node1 ip address
  tasks:
    - name: copy the files from loal to remote
	  copy:
	    src: /home/ansible/opt/playbooks/myweb-8.2.0.war
	    dest: /usr/local/apache-tomca-8.05/webapps 
	
now we need to create job in jenkins
=====================================
1.click on new item 
2.select freestylejob
3.give the github ur4.cleanpackage
4 click on build step and selct send war through the ssh
   under source file ---:target/*.war
        remove prefix---/target
		remote directory--/opt/playbooks
		exec command--- ansible-playbook/home/ansible/copy.yml
		
upto here war file will generate and is placed at /opt/playbooks path
then it copy to the webapps folder of tomcat


build now

here we observe that war file is not copied to tomcat so we have to  run mannually
