s3:
=======
there are two types of databases are there they are
1.user data--->it is stored in databases 
2.application database--->this stored storages

diferences between volumes and s3
   volumes                       s3
 1.using of volume is under      1.ec2 machine is not requre to login to s3
 instance.it is mandatory        
 withpuit login to machine we 
 can't login to vaolum
 2.what ever you store inside 
 the volume,we call it as files  2.here we store the files in buckets and 
                                  these files are called as objects
 
 3.the machine and volume are in 3.the machine is in any zone we can store the data 
 same zone then only we can store 
 the data
 4.two machines cannot access my  4.two machines simutaneously acces my  
 volume at same time                   s3 bucket
 5.one machine is linux and other 5.here comptibilty is there any type of
 machine is windows then the        we can attach
 compaibilty is not provided
 we must formate volume then
 we canattach.
 6.volumes very cost               6.less cost compared to volumes
 7.max storage is 16.3 TB           7.the max size is 100 TB
 8.ex:if 100 gb file is there.      8.here we can upload 100 gb ata time 
 we cannot upload single time.      s3 smatret storage service
we can upload 25gb ata time 

then we have to follow some steps to create s3 bucket and upload the file in s3 bucket
s3 also provide one good thing.that is it can provide versioning
like verion controle system like git.modification files are store indifferent 
versions.eventhough  the file name is same we can save different content with same name.
it can maintain versioning

in properties column it has some other features

we can enable static website hosting--->by select properties-->godown and select enable  website hosting
--->hosta as a static website--->index document:index.html.txt-->error.html--->save changes


goto s3 bucket -->go undewebsite hosting --->click on the link

now we need to give two types of perssions required for s3 bucket
1.bucket  permission
2.object permission   
go under ACL (acces control list)--->click on bucket owner enforce--->select enable ACL
everyone(publi acces)  click on list  and click on read
go down and select (i understand)--->click on save changes


now goto objects
click on one object and goto permissions and repeate thesame steps 

using this steps we can run a website from our s3 bucket
